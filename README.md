# A Python application that is reading  the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) dataset and then uses a RNN to do sentiment classification using Tensorflow. 
# Proper text preprocessing is done. Properly converted into embeddings. 
# We want to run this application in VS Code on my local Machine. 
# Save the model into a .h5 file. Use a Streamlit web app as the User Interface and make sure it can be deployed. 
# Please make sure the RNN is simple and is trained to perform better. Please make sure the application can make a prediction.
